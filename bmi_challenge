#Body Mass Index Calculator 2.0

#the formula for BMI is WEIGHT / HEIGHT^2

#get input for height and weight // convert from string to float

h = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
w = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))



#divide the numbers

bmi = round(w / h ** 2)


#under 18.5 - underweight \\ 18.5-25 - normal \\ 25 - 30 overweight \\ 30-35 - obese \\ above 35 clinically obese

if bmi < 18.5:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are underweight")

elif bmi < 25:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you have a normal weight")

elif bmi < 30:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are slightly overweight.")

elif bmi < 35:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are obese")

else:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are clinically obese.")
