#Leap Year challenge

#normal year has 365, but leap year has extra day in Feb

#formula: every year that is divisible by 4, EXCEPT every year that is evenly divisible by 100, unless the year is ALSO evenly divisible by 400

#prompt user to input year
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))


#---the logic is important. Logic begins as Boolean True---***


#is year divisible evenly by 4? Yes? Then next logic. No? then Not leap.
if year % 4 == 0:
    #is year divisible evenly by 100? No? then Leap. Yes? then check against 400.
    if year % 100 == 0:
        #is year divisible evenly by 400? Yes? Leap. No? then Not leap.
        if year % 400 == 0:
            print("Leap year.")

        else:
            print("Not leap year.")

    else:
        print("Leap year.")

else:
    print("Not leap year.")
